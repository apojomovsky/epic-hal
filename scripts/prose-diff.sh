# Diff-scoped prose surface for the takeoff ritual's comment/doc review
# step (AGENTS.md): a thin wrapper over `epic-tasks prose`, so the lint
# rules live in exactly one place and every epic repository runs the
# same check. Prints every added comment block in BASE_REF...HEAD with
# its location, class and id; `--verify` exits 1 with the fix list when
# a block violates the mechanical prose rules (line caps, decoration,
# narrative, em-dash). The judgment rules (why not what, earns its
# lines) are the reviewer's, applied while reading the listing.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/prose-diff.sh [--verify]
#   --verify exit 1 with the fix list when blocks violate the rules
#   BASE_REF overrides the base branch (forks: BASE_REF=<fork>/master)
