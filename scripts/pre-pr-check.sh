# Unified takeoff, a thin wrapper around `epic-tasks takeoff`, so every
# epic repo runs the same canonical checks (worktree discipline, prose
# lint, hygiene). This file only preserves `make pre-pr-check` as the
# entry point and forwards flags.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/pre-pr-check.sh [--test] [--base <ref>]
#   --test   also run the full suite
#   --base   base ref to diff against (default origin/master or $BASE_REF)
